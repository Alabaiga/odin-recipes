    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have gathered all your ingredients, lets get started!
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
                Then gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Then add the salt and butter. Beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle (or frying pan if you prefer) over medium high heat. Then pour or scoop some of the batter
                onto the griddle using roughly 1/4 cup per crepe. Tilt the pan in a circular motion so that the batter coats the entire surface
                evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, or just until the bottom is light brown. Flip and cook the other side until it is light brown as well.
                Serve hot with your favorite filling or fruit!</li>
        </ol>
